    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Gideon Harris</strong> (<em>he/him</em>); I am a sophmore 
        in Creative Technology and Design engineering at CU Boulder. I hope with this course
         to develope a portfolio page for all of my theater work. As mentioned, I love theater, 
         and I hope to one day be a technical director for Broadway shows, movies, and tv shows.<p>
