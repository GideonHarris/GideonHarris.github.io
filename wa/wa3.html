    <h2>Band Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice in Chains</strong> (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1987. Since 2006, the band's lineup has comprised vocalist/guitarists Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall, bassist Mike Inez and drummer Sean Kinney. Vocalist Layne Staley and bassist Mike Starr are former members of the band. The band took its name from Staley's previous band, Alice N' Chains.[1][2] Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound and style is deeply rooted in heavy metal. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style,[3] which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell[4] (and later Cantrell and DuVall).[5]<br />

        Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with the albums <em>Facelift</em> (1990), <em>Dirt</em> (1992) and <em>Alice in Chains</em> (1995), as well as the extended play <em>Jar of Flies</em>> (1994). The band was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, largely due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002 and caused the band to go on hiatus. Alice in Chains regrouped in 2005, with DuVall joining in 2006 as rhythm guitarist and sharing lead vocal duties; the band has since released three more albums: <em>Black Gives Way to Blue</em>(2009), <em>The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here</em> (2013) and <em>Rainier Fog</em> (2018).<br />
        <br />
        Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos[6][7] and 32 singles. The band has sold more than 30 million records worldwide,[8] and over 20 million records in the US alone.[9] It has had 18 Top 10 songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart[10] and 5 No. 1 hits,[10] and has received eleven Grammy Award nominations.[11][12] The band was ranked number 34 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock special and as the 15th greatest live band by Hit Parader.<br /></p>

            Before the formation of Alice in Chains, Layne Staley, a drummer at the time,[13][14] landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer.[13][14] Other members of this group at that time were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen.[13]<br />
This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains.[15] This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with Russ Klatt, the lead singer of Slaughter Haus 5,[16] about backstage passes.[15] One of the passes said "Welcome to Wonderland", and they started talking about that being a reference to Alice in Wonderland, until Klatt said, "What about Alice in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that."[17]<br />

Bacolas liked the name "Alice in Chains" and brought it up to his bandmates; they agreed and decided to change the band's name.[17] Due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it differently as Alice N' Chains to allay any parental concerns,[17] though Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she was still not happy with this name at first.[15] According to Bacolas, the decision to use the apostrophe-N combination in their name had nothing to do with the band Guns N' Roses.[18] The name change happened a year before Guns N' Roses became a household name with their first album, Appetite for Destruction, released in July of 1987.[18]<br />
<br />


Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a party in Seattle around August 1987.[19][20] A few months prior, Cantrell had watched a concert of Alice N' Chains in his hometown at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by Staley's voice.[21] Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house,[22] so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank.[20][23]<br />
<br />
Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band.[2] Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could set up a meeting with Kinney.[23] Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose.[23] Kinney mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids.[23] Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank.[23]<br />
<br />
Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman.[2][20] Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band. Because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint.[20][23][24] When they auditioned a male stripper, Staley decided to join the band.[23] Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis.[20] Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at Washington State University, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original songs along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.[24]<br />
<br />
The band played a couple of gigs in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, calling themselves different monikers, including Diamond Lie,[25] the name of Cantrell's previous band,[26] and "Fuck",[23] before eventually adopting the name that Staley's previous band had initially flirted with, Alice in Chains.[23][27][28] Staley contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name.[29] Nick Pollock was not particularly thrilled about it at the time, and thought he should come up with a different name; both he and James Bergstrom ultimately gave Staley their blessing to use the name.[29]<br />
<br />


Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state.[27] The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes and found its way to music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A&R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on The Treehouse Tapes, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.[27]<br /><br />

    Alice in Chains soon became a top priority of the label, which released the band's first official recording in July 1990, a promotional EP called We Die Young. The EP's lead single, "We Die Young", became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains' debut album into production with producer Dave Jerden.[30] Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a "moody aura" that was a "direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle."[31]<br /><br />

The resulting album, Facelift, was released on August 21, 1990, peaking at number 42 in the summer of 1991 on the Billboard 200 chart.[32] Facelift was not an instant success, selling under 40,000 copies in the first six months of release, until MTV added "Man in the Box" to regular daytime rotation.[33] The single hit number 18 on the Mainstream rock charts, with the album's follow up single, "Sea of Sorrow", reaching number 27,[10] and in six weeks Facelift sold 400,000 copies in the US.[33] The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of AllMusic citing Facelift as "one of the most important records in establishing an audience for grunge and alternative rock among hard rock and heavy metal listeners."[34] Sammy Hagar claimed he invited the band to tour with Van Halen after he saw the music video for "Man In The Box" on MTV.[35][36]<br /><br /></section>
